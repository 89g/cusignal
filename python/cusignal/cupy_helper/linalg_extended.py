def toeplitz(c, r=None):
    """
    Construct a Toeplitz matrix.
    The Toeplitz matrix has constant diagonals, with c as its first column
    and r as its first row.  If r is not given, ``r == conjugate(c)`` is
    assumed.
    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        First column of the matrix.  Whatever the actual shape of `c`, it
        will be converted to a 1-D array.
    r : array_like, optional
        First row of the matrix. If None, ``r = conjugate(c)`` is assumed;
        in this case, if c[0] is real, the result is a Hermitian matrix.
        r[0] is ignored; the first row of the returned matrix is
        ``[c[0], r[1:]]``.  Whatever the actual shape of `r`, it will be
        converted to a 1-D array.
    Returns
    -------
    A : (len(c), len(r)) ndarray
        The Toeplitz matrix. Dtype is the same as ``(c[0] + r[0]).dtype``.
    See Also
    --------
    circulant : circulant matrix
    hankel : Hankel matrix
    solve_toeplitz : Solve a Toeplitz system.
    Notes
    -----
    The behavior when `c` or `r` is a scalar, or when `c` is complex and
    `r` is None, was changed in version 0.8.0.  The behavior in previous
    versions was undocumented and is no longer supported.
    Examples
    --------
    >>> from scipy.linalg import toeplitz
    >>> toeplitz([1,2,3], [1,4,5,6])
    array([[1, 4, 5, 6],
           [2, 1, 4, 5],
           [3, 2, 1, 4]])

def hankel(c, r=None):
    """
    Construct a Hankel matrix.
    The Hankel matrix has constant anti-diagonals, with `c` as its
    first column and `r` as its last row.  If `r` is not given, then
    `r = zeros_like(c)` is assumed.
    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        First column of the matrix.  Whatever the actual shape of `c`, it
        will be converted to a 1-D array.
    r : array_like, optional
        Last row of the matrix. If None, ``r = zeros_like(c)`` is assumed.
        r[0] is ignored; the last row of the returned matrix is
        ``[c[-1], r[1:]]``.  Whatever the actual shape of `r`, it will be
